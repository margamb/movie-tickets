# Movie Tickets

A movie booking ticket app I created to improve my react and javascript.

If you want to see the demo of this project deployed, you can take a look [here](https://margamb.github.io/movie-tickets/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How it works

![](src/img/flow-app.jpg)

- Click to poster image to choose the movie.
- Book Ticket.
- Click on the seat icon to choose seats, you can choose time and pay the ticket.
- Finally, the ticket will appear with the information and one animation.

### Technologies used

- React
- HTML
- CSS

### What I have learned

- How to change the view with react router.
- How to keep the state of the movie choosed, passing the id.movie to the url.
- How to use array.keys() method, it is used to return a new array iterator which contains the keys for each index in the given input array (const id = [...Array().keys()];)
- How to choose seats.
- How to use useLocation()

In the project directory, you can run:

### How to run locally

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
