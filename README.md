# Movie Tickets

A movie booking ticket app I created to improve my react and javascript.

If you want to see the demo of this project deployed, you can take a look [here](https://margamb.github.io/movie-tickets/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How it works

- Click to poster image to choose the movie.
- Book Ticket.
- Click on the seat icon to choose seats, you can choose time and pay the ticket.
- Finally, the ticket will appear with the information and one animation.

### Technologies used

- React
- React Router
- CSS

### What I have learned

- How to change the view with react router.
- How to keep the state of the movie choosed, passing the id.movie to the url.
- How to use array.keys() method, it is used to return a new array iterator which contains the keys for each index in the given input array (const id = [...Array().keys()];)
- How to choose seats.
- How to use useLocation()

### How to run locally

In the project directory, you can run the usual create-react-app scripts



#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
